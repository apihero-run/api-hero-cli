# API Hero CLI

# Usage

We recommend using `npx`:

```shell
npx apihero@latest add GitHub
```

## Commands

### Add

To add an API to your project, run this command in the root of your project:

```shell
npx apihero@latest add GitHub
```

It will guide you through authenticating the CLI if you haven't already finished that on your machine.

Then it will search for the API you typed in ("GitHub" in the example above). It will show results for you to select from.

Once you have selected an API it will add it to your API Hero project and install the npm package for that API.

Also, you will need to select the framework you wish to add (currently React or Node).

### Help

```shell
npx apihero@latest --help
```

Will list all of the possible commands, and link you to our documentation.
